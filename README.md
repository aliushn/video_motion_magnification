# Video Motion Magnification

This project aims to reimplement phase base video motion magnification in python.

The main algorithm is in phaseAmplify.ipynb. This file assumes the presence of filter_tools.py, pyramid_tools.py, and util.py.

* filter_tools is a python file full of filtering algorithms.
* pyramid_tools contains a bunch of functions dedicated to working with the steerable pyramid.
* util.py just has misc IO functions.

See the site zip for more information about this project and this algorithm.

Enjoy!
